      <p>Motivation and <b>identity</b> go hand in hand in educational contexts. Language learning motivation is shaped by factors <b>internal</b> and <b>external</b> to the Self. Internal factors include  cognition, attitudes and affective factors (e.g. enjoyment, anxiety), and individual characteristics (e.g. gender, age, personality).  External factors, on the other hand, are complex social, cultural and contextual influences, e.g. teachers, peers, classroom tasks and materials, and cultural values and beliefs.  Motivation thus emerges through complicated <i>processes</i> of interacton between the Self and context.</p>

      <p>One's sense of competence and <b>autonomy</b> seem to be  particularly important for the development of <b>intrinsic</b> forms of motivation; being in control of your own learning is thus important.  Remember that your language learning motivation can also be influenced by reasons fluctuating on a daily basis: your health, the weather, your mood, work and personal conflicts, that is,  your very own <b>ecological realities</b> in life: we are all different flesh and blood human beings with our commitments and duties!</p>
