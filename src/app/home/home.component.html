    <p>Every <b>language learner</b> is a unique blend of personal characteristics and background factors which affects the experience of learning.</p>

    <p>The characteristics and background factors are not stable, but like the pattern in a <b>KALEIDOSCOPE</b> they change with time and context.</p>

    <p> Have you ever thought about yourself as a language learner? How do you feel about your skills? What do you need languages for? Do you really want to learn more? How does your personality affect the way you learn? What kind of experiences of learning languages have you had so far?</p>

    <p>Reflecting on these questions will help you to plan and decide how you want to proceed with your language studies. <b>KALEIDOSCOPE</b> is here to help you with this reflection. On the following pages, you will see and hear students talking about themselves.</p>

    <p>We also hope that you will spend a few minutes telling us what you think about <b>KALEIDOSCOPE</b>. On your Profile page there is a space for you to write your comments.</p>
    <p><b>Please come and join in the Kaleidoscope dialogue!</b></p>
